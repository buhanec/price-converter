A simple price conversion tool.

This is meant to simplify some personal daily tasks and not to be used in any
reasonably important workflow, process or relied upon in any production 
situation.

This might become a bit more sensible and better designed at a future date.

## Examples

```bash
$ priceconverter '$1000' EUR
1189.1000000000001

$ priceconverter '.5 USD' EUR
0.59455

$ priceconverter GBP USD
0.7212429569
```
